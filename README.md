## Concept

Pocket Karaoke transforms an iPhone into a real-time performance microphone and smart controller. Users can view lyrics and visuals on an external screen (TV, monitor, or projector) via HDMI or AirPlay, while adjusting pitch, tempo, and guide vocal levels from their handheld device.

The goal is zero-perceptible latency and local audio control, optimized for wired output and Apple-native performance protocols (AVAudioEngine, AirPlay video mirroring, CoreAudio). Unlike social singing apps, Pocket Karaoke is built for *in-person* use: bars, hotels, small events, and homes.

This repository serves as a timestamped public record of authorship and conceptual design. Additional assets, UI mockups, and technical documentation will be posted under this anchor as development progresses.
